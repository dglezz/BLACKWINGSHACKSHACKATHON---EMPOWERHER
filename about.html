      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      
      <p>Social good is defined as any activity that provides some sort of benefit to the     general public. EmpowerHer is a free platform that girls/women from every walk of life can use to improve their health and wellness journey and feel in charge of the process. When women are in good health, they are empowered to succeed in many other areas of life. “Health is wealth”         </p>
      <p>EmpowerHer seeks to make paying attention to health and wellness for women fun, engaging, and less forced. It can often feel laborious to prioritize one’s health, but it doesn’t have to be that way with the EmpowerHer app. With the friend challenges, users are encouraged to have fun with their friends while keeping up with their wellness goals.
